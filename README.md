# Context

In India, the housing landscape spans from opulent palaces once owned by royalty to contemporary apartment complexes in major cities, as well as modest huts in remote villages. The country's housing sector has witnessed significant expansion, driven by increasing incomes. According to the Human Rights Measurement Initiative, India has achieved 60.9% of what is theoretically attainable for ensuring the right to housing, given its income level.

Renting, also referred to as hiring or letting, involves an arrangement where a payment is made to temporarily utilize a product, service, or property owned by someone else. A gross lease, for instance, is when the tenant pays a fixed rental fee, and the landlord is responsible for covering all regular property-related expenses. Renting serves as an example of the sharing economy.

# Key Insights And Conclusion:

#### Property Size and Configuration:
The number of bathrooms and the size of the property are the most crucial factors influencing rent prices. Property owners and renters should pay close attention to these features when setting or evaluating rent rates.

#### City of Mumbai:
Mumbai stands out as a city with significantly higher rent prices. This suggests a higher demand for rental properties in Mumbai and a potential premium on rental rates in this city.

#### Point of Contact:
The choice of whom to contact for property inquiries, such as "Contact Agent" and "Contact Owner," also influences rent prices. Property owners and agents should consider the impact of communication methods.

#### Number of Bedrooms (BHK):
The property's layout and the number of bedrooms, halls, and kitchens (BHK) have a substantial impact, particularly in the Decision Tree model. This underscores the importance of property size and configuration in setting rent prices.

#### Other Factors:
Tenant preferences, furnishing status, and area types have a relatively lower impact on rent prices. While they still play a role, their influence is not as pronounced as property size and location.
